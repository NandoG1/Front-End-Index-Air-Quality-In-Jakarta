JAKARTA WEATHER AI - PROJECT DESCRIPTION
==========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
Jakarta Weather AI is an intelligent web application that provides weather predictions and air quality classification for Jakarta, Indonesia. The application leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning models to analyze environmental data and deliver accurate forecasts to help users make informed decisions about their daily activities and health precautions.

The system offers 3 main prediction modes:
1. Date-based weather prediction - Users can select specific dates to get weather forecasts
2. Parameter-based air quality classification - Users can input environmental parameters to get real-time air quality 
3. ChatBot using Gemini API
